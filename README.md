## More "Material-ish" Components

These components are based on Material Design and built on top of `package:angular_components`. 

The goal is to provide a couple of components that seems to be missing from angular_components. 

**Currently Available components:**

* ✓ `<skawa-appbar>`
* ✓ `<skawa-card>`
* ✓ `<skawa-data-table>`
* ✓ `<skawa-drawer>`
* ✓ `<skawa-infobar>`
* ✓ `<skawa-master-detail>`
* ✓ `<skawa-nav-item>`
* ✓ `<skawa-sidebar>`
* ✓ `<skawa-sidebar-item>`
* ✓ `<skawa-ckeditor>`
* ✓ `<skawa-grid>`
* ✓ `randomColorize` (it is a pipe)
* ✓ `<skawa-snackbar>`
* ✓ `<skawa-markdown-editor>`
* ☐ `<skawa-virtual-scrollbar>`

Both packages are being actively maintained, meaning components get added and removed. 
In case of a component from this list is added to angular_components, it will be 
deprecated and eventually removed from skawa_components.
